Thank you for purchasing the Low Poly Japanese Alley Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
I recommend you to use the Post Processing Stack, which is available for free on Unity.

 
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!

If you like the pack I would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
